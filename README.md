Prodigy Infotech - Data Science Internship
Track Code: PRODIGY_DS_01
Task: Visualizing Distribution with Bar Chart / Histogram

ðŸ“Œ About the Task
As a part of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech, this task focuses on creating a visualization to show the distribution of a variable using either a bar chart (for categorical data like gender) or a histogram (for continuous data like age).
The objective is to represent data distribution clearly and effectively using professional data visualization techniques.

ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries Used
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

ðŸ“Š Output
* Bar Chart: Visualizing gender distribution
* Histogram: Visualizing age distribution
These charts help interpret demographic data visually, identifying patterns or imbalances in the dataset.

ðŸŽ¯ Outcome
Successfully implemented data visualization to show how values are distributed in a dataset. This is a key skill in data analysis and helps in quick and effective decision-making.
